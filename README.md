# FriendFinder

This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Deployed Heroku link
https://protected-caverns-19224.herokuapp.com/home

## Functionality
Type name, insert a URL to a photo, and answer three questions using drop down menus

## Success
1. all required routes function
2. users are able to post their information into the friends array

## Incomplete
1. Modules are not used. Most logic is written in the server.js file
2. Comparing question answers with existing objects in the friends array is not functioning
3. Modal is coded, but not tested since the comparing algorithm does not work

## Getting Started
Before running `server.js` you must install the npm dependencies
`npm install`

## Built With
Javascript, Node.js, Express, Heroku
